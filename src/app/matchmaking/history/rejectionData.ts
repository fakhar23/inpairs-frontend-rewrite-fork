  "Salam! While I can see how some values might align, I think the great age difference combined with my personal attraction levels made it a hard no for me. His profile responses also were rather shallow. I'm not opposed to someone older (12 years is quite the gap) due to the fact that older people tend to be much more mature, but the shallow answers made it hard to feel that sense of maturity. I also generally don't appreciate shallow answers, though I can understand occasionally why some might choose to. He seems nice though and I pray Allah SWT grants him a wonderful match soon!",

Though a lot of attraction for me comes from in-person things like charisma and personality, I'm struggling with that a bit here. I also am hesitant with his age as it is very uncommon for guys my age or less to be matured and un-naive. He also has an eerie amount of similarities with my brother, which made me a bit uncomfortable lol (the grooming style choice and coffee hobby lol).

There are a lot of things I appreciated about this match, he works remotely so maybe has the flexibility to move, he is an Arab which is great for me, and seems passionate about what he does.
